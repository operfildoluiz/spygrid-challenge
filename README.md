Created with CodeSandbox

## Issues and approaches

- CodeSandbox Beta Editor uses a React environment that dpends on a `react-scripts` version that adds [a strange iframe that prevents all user interactions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69051008/react-injecting-iframe-with-max-z-index-on-reload-after-changes-development). Fix: first connect CodeSandbox SSH with local VS Code to be able to clean the node_modules and upgrade `react-scripts` package.
